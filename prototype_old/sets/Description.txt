We examined whether a short training (eight weeks) in second-language (L2-English) to university students has any facilitative effects on their executive functions. One group received English language training for two months and a control group matched on age and background did not receive any training. We administered objective language task (object-naming) and executive function tasks (Flanker, Stroop and colour-shape switching task) before and after the course. We found that the group that received the training improved significantly on the colour-shape switching task but no improvements were found on the Stroop or the Flanker tasks. Their object-naming latency on English also became faster compared to the control group after the training. The control groupâ€™s performance was not different at these two time points. We conclude that even a short training in second-language can enhance some components of executive functions beyond improving language skills in young adult students. We discuss the results with reference to similar other training studies and the effect of language learning on cognitive aspects of neuroplasticity.
